README for Madi Atkins' 206 Final Project
OMDb & Twitter API
========

Final Project pulls data from the OMDb online API regarding three movies of the programmers choice (in my case, Rogue One, Hidden Figures, and Lazer Team).
It then pulls data in the form of tweets from the Twitter Search API in order to compare which of the three movies are most talked about (in regards to agregated retweet and favorite count).
